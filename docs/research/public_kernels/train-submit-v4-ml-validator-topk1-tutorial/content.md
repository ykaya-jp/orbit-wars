# Orbit Wars — v4 + ML Shot Validator + topk1 Throttle

**Reference LB ~1049** (at the time of publishing)

This notebook reproduces the agent `v4_mlhybrid_t30_topk1` end-to-end. We train a small ML shot validator on top of a strong rule-based base agent, throttle moves down to one per turn, and produce a `submission.tar.gz` ready for the Orbit Wars competition — all inside this single Kaggle notebook.

## Acknowledgments

This work builds directly on excellent public Kaggle notebooks. **Huge thanks to the authors** for sharing their work:

Without these public agents, the hybrid approach in this notebook would not exist.

## Pipeline Overview

1. **Strategy overview** — why a 3-layer hybrid works
2. **Environment setup** — install `kaggle-environments` (offline from a bundled wheel)
3. **Data collection** — v4 self-plays vs 5 opponents, every shot is recorded with a success/failure label
4. **Feature extraction** — 24-dim hand-crafted features per shot
5. **Model training** — small MLP with PyTorch (CUDA → CPU fallback)
6. **NumPy export** — convert weights so the Kaggle submission can run without PyTorch
7. **Agent assembly** — combine v4 source + numpy validator + topk1 wrapper into a single `main.py`
8. **`submission.tar.gz`** — ready to submit

## Strategy: 3-layer hybrid

```
v4 (rule-based foundation, ~3,400 lines)
   ↓ proposes ~6.7 moves per turn
ML shot validator (3-layer MLP, ~3,500 params)
   ↓ drops moves with success probability < 0.30
topk1 throttle (a one-line filter)
   ↓ keeps only the largest fleet move
final action: at most 1 move per turn
```

### Why this works

We analyzed 191 top replays:

| Agent | Moves / turn | Idle turns |
|---|---|---|
| `LB #1` | **1.3** | **63%** |
| `v4` baseline | 6.7 | 4% |

Top-tier players **wait, accumulate, and then strike decisively**. `v4` instead sprays small moves every turn, leaving its home garrison thin and vulnerable to counter-attacks.

- **`topk1`** keeps only the move with the largest ship count per turn — a 41-line wrapper around `v4`. This alone gives **+4.5 LB** over plain `v4`.
- **ML validator** learns "does this attack actually capture the planet?" and drops low-probability shots, letting `topk1` pick from a pre-filtered pool.

The two layers act on **different axes** (target quality vs. over-aggression), so combining them compounds: `topk1` alone reached LB 892, the ML+topk1 hybrid reached LB ~1049 ( **+75 LB** ).

## 0. Prerequisites (important)

To run this notebook you need:

1. **`obn_v4_exp004ish.py`** — the v4 base agent source (3,378 lines). This is `orbitbotnext` (by Pascal Ledesma) extended with 6 constant tunings drawn from public LB-1224 / LB-1100 notebooks. Place it in a Kaggle Dataset and attach.
2. **`kaggle_environments-1.28.1-py3-none-any.whl`** — needed because Kaggle's preinstalled `kaggle_environments` does not yet include the `orbit_wars` environment, AND competition-linked notebooks have internet disabled. We install it offline from a bundled wheel.

Both files are bundled in a single dataset (recommended slug: `orbit-wars-v4-base`). The next cell looks up the v4 source from that dataset.

## [CODE]
```python
# Locate v4 source
import os
from pathlib import Path

# ↓ Adjust to match your dataset slug
DATASET_SLUG = "orbit-wars-v4-base"
V4_PATH = Path(f"/kaggle/input/datasets/konbu17/{DATASET_SLUG}/obn_v4_exp004ish.py")

# Fallback: if a copy already exists in /kaggle/working/, use that
if not V4_PATH.exists():
    fallback = Path("/kaggle/working/obn_v4_exp004ish.py")
    if fallback.exists():
        V4_PATH = fallback

assert V4_PATH.exists(), (
    f"v4 base not found.\n"
    f"Please attach a Kaggle Dataset slugged `{DATASET_SLUG}` containing\n"
    f"`obn_v4_exp004ish.py`, OR place the file at `/kaggle/working/obn_v4_exp004ish.py` directly."
)

# Copy to working dir for the rest of the pipeline
WORK = Path("/kaggle/working")
WORK.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
import shutil
V4_LOCAL = WORK / "obn_v4_exp004ish.py"
shutil.copy(V4_PATH, V4_LOCAL)
print(f"v4 base loaded: {V4_LOCAL} ({V4_LOCAL.stat().st_size:,} bytes)")
```

## [MD]
## 1. Environment setup

The `orbit_wars` environment was added in `kaggle-environments` 1.28+, but the Kaggle default image ships an older version. **Competition-linked notebooks also have internet disabled**, so we install the wheel offline from the bundled dataset.

## [CODE]
```python
# Kaggle's preinstalled kaggle_environments doesn't include orbit_wars,
# AND competition-linked notebooks have internet disabled.
# So we install from the wheel bundled in our dataset.
import sys, subprocess, glob, os as _os

WHEEL_GLOB = "/kaggle/input/datasets/konbu17/orbit-wars-v4-base/kaggle_environments-*.whl"
wheels = glob.glob(WHEEL_GLOB)
assert wheels, f"wheel not found at {WHEEL_GLOB} — make sure dataset 'orbit-wars-v4-base' is attached"
wheel = wheels[0]
print(f"Installing {wheel}")
subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "-q", "--upgrade", wheel], check=True)

# Reload to pick up the new version (in case kaggle_environments was already imported)
import importlib, kaggle_environments
importlib.reload(kaggle_environments)
envs = sorted(_os.listdir(_os.path.join(_os.path.dirname(kaggle_environments.__file__), "envs")))
print(f"kaggle_environments {kaggle_environments.__version__}; orbit_wars available: {'orbit_wars' in envs}")
assert "orbit_wars" in envs, f"orbit_wars not in envs: {envs}"

import torch
print(f"torch {torch.__version__}, cuda available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
```

## 2. Define baseline opponents for self-play

We need opponents to generate training data. The original `exp_arch_001` pipeline uses 5 stronger agents (`v1_sniper`, `v2_structured`, `exp007_tier3/4`, `orbitbotnext`), but for a self-contained public notebook we use 5 simple agents written inline:

- `nearest_sniper` — attack the nearest non-allied planet (the official sample agent)
- `weakest_first` — attack the planet with the fewest defenders
- `production_first` — prioritize high-production planets
- `defender` — consolidate ships toward your own planets
- `random_play` — purely random shots (negative-class generator)

A stronger opponent pool produces a stronger validator. If you have access to better agents, swap them in by replacing the entries in `OPPONENT_CODES` below or pointing `OPPONENT_PATHS` at external files.

## 3. Data collection (self-play)

We run v4 against 5 opponents × 6 seeds × 2 sides = **60 games**. Every move v4 issues is recorded as a *shot* with three pieces:

- **Source** = `(src_id, ang, ships)` — the move v4 picked
- **Features** = a 24-dim vector describing the board state at the moment of the shot (next section)
- **Label** = was this shot ultimately **successful**? Specifically: did v4 own the target planet within 10 turns of the projected fleet arrival?

So the validator learns a binary classifier: **"will this attack actually capture the target?"**

**Time budget**: roughly 5–10 minutes on Kaggle CPU.

## 4. Train the ML shot validator

**Model**: a tiny 3-layer MLP (24 → 64 → 32 → 1), about 3,500 parameters total. Small enough to inference in ~1 ms on CPU during the Kaggle 1-second-per-turn match.

**Training settings**:
- Loss: `BCEWithLogitsLoss` with `pos_weight = (1 - pos_rate) / pos_rate` to correct class imbalance
- Optimizer: Adam, lr=1e-3
- Epochs: 40
- **Validation**: 20% holdout split **at the game level** — random row-level split would leak, since shots within the same game are temporally correlated.

Runs in ~30 seconds on CPU; ~5 seconds on GPU. (We auto-fall-back to CPU if CUDA fails, since the model is tiny anyway.)

## 5. Export weights to NumPy

The Kaggle submission environment does not include PyTorch. We convert the trained weights to a NumPy `.npz` file and inference becomes a simple chain of matmuls + ReLU + sigmoid (1 ms or less per turn).

## [CODE]
```python
model.eval()
sd = model.state_dict()
weights = {
    "l0_w": sd["net.0.weight"].cpu().numpy().astype(np.float32),
    "l0_b": sd["net.0.bias"].cpu().numpy().astype(np.float32),
    "l1_w": sd["net.2.weight"].cpu().numpy().astype(np.float32),
    "l1_b": sd["net.2.bias"].cpu().numpy().astype(np.float32),
    "l2_w": sd["net.4.weight"].cpu().numpy().astype(np.float32),
    "l2_b": sd["net.4.bias"].cpu().numpy().astype(np.float32),
}
for k, v in weights.items():
    print(f"  {k}: {v.shape}, {v.dtype}")

weights_path = WORK / "weights.npz"
np.savez(weights_path, **weights)
print(f"\nSaved {weights_path} ({weights_path.stat().st_size:,} bytes)")

# Sanity check: parity between PyTorch and numpy forward
def numpy_forward(x, W):
    h = np.maximum(0, x @ W["l0_w"].T + W["l0_b"])
    h = np.maximum(0, h @ W["l1_w"].T + W["l1_b"])
    logit = h @ W["l2_w"].T + W["l2_b"]
    return 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-logit))

x_test = Xv[:5]
with torch.no_grad():
    p_torch = torch.sigmoid(model(torch.from_numpy(x_test).to(device))).cpu().numpy()
p_numpy = numpy_forward(x_test, weights).squeeze()
print(f"\nParity check (PyTorch vs numpy):")
print(f"  torch: {p_torch[:5]}")

## 6. Assemble `main.py`

We splice three components into a single submission file:

1. The full v4 source (3,378 lines), with its `agent` function renamed to `_v4_agent_internal` so we can wrap it
2. A `_NumpyValidator`-style forward function (24 → 64 → 32 → 1 with ReLU + sigmoid)
3. A new `agent(obs, config)` that:
   - calls `_v4_agent_internal` to get v4's full proposal list
   - sends each move's features through the validator and **drops moves with P < 0.30**
   - keeps only the **single largest-ship-count move** that survives (= topk1)

## [CODE]
```python
# Read v4 source
v4_source = V4_LOCAL.read_text()
print(f"v4 source: {len(v4_source.splitlines()):,} lines, {len(v4_source):,} chars")

# Hybrid wrapper (renames v4's `agent` to `_v4_agent_internal` so we can wrap it)

## 7. Sanity check

Run a single game with the freshly-built `main.py` to make sure it loads, runs, and finishes without errors.

## [CODE]
```python
# Sanity test: run a 1-game match to confirm the agent works
from kaggle_environments import make

env = make("orbit_wars", debug=True)
result = env.run([str(WORK / "main.py"), OPPONENT_PATHS[0]])  # vs nearest_sniper
final = env.steps[-1]

for i, s in enumerate(final):
    print(f"  P{i}: reward={s.reward}, status={s.status}")

## 8. Build `submission.tar.gz`

Bundle `main.py` + `weights.npz` into the tar.gz format that Kaggle expects.

## [CODE]
```python
import tarfile

tar_path = WORK / "submission.tar.gz"
with tarfile.open(tar_path, "w:gz") as tar:
    tar.add(WORK / "main.py", arcname="main.py")
    tar.add(WORK / "weights.npz", arcname="weights.npz")

size = tar_path.stat().st_size
print(f"\n✅ Submission ready: {tar_path} ({size:,} bytes = {size/1024:.1f} KB)")

## 9. How to submit

Two options:

### A. Submit this notebook directly (recommended)

1. Click **Save Version** at the top right of the notebook → "Save & Run All (Commit)"
2. From the notebook page, click **Submit to Competition** on the right → choose `submission.tar.gz`

Kaggle automatically picks up `/kaggle/working/submission.tar.gz`.

### B. Download and submit via CLI

1. Download `submission.tar.gz` from the notebook output
2. Locally:
   ```bash
   kaggle competitions submit orbit-wars -f submission.tar.gz -m "v4 + ML validator (t=0.30) + topk1"
   ```

## 10. Expected score

- **LB ~1040** ballpark. Note: the opponent pool used here is a self-contained set of **simple** baseline agents, weaker than the original `exp_arch_001` pool (`v1_sniper`, `v2_structured`, `exp007_tier3/4`, `orbitbotnext`). With those stronger opponents, scores tend to come in slightly higher.
- To push higher, try:
  - swapping in stronger opponents (e.g., the public `orbit-botnext` notebook by Pascal Ledesma)
  - increasing data collection from 60 games to 120+
  - sweeping `_VAL_THRESHOLD` over {0.25, 0.30, 0.35} and picking the best by validation accuracy

## 11. Improvement ideas

1. **Train against stronger opponents** — the agent's known weakness is matchups vs LB-≥1000 opponents (~20% win rate). Including stronger agents in the data-collection pool should help directly.
2. **Richer features** — add comet info, planet orbital velocity, and rotation phase to the 24-dim feature vector.
3. **Validator ensemble** — train one MLP on the v1 dataset and one on a hard-negatives augmented dataset, accept a shot only if both approve.
4. **Dynamic threshold** — vary `_VAL_THRESHOLD` by game phase (stricter early, looser late, or vice versa).
