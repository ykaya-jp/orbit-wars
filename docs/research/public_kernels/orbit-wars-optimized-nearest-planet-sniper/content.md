# Orbit Wars | Optimized Nearest Sniper

This notebook builds off of the [Getting Started notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bovard/getting-started/notebook).

The initial notebook only consisted of a nearst planet sniper, which scanned for nearest planet, and sent `planet_ships + 1`, just enough to capture it. That's it, rinse and repeat.

I've implemented the following optimizations:
- Planets cannot send multiple fleets to the same planet.
- Calculate the angle for moving planets.
- Account for ship production on planet before launching fleets. (eg. ensure enough ships are sent to capture planet that's producing ships)
- When opponent has 6 planets left, all owned planets initiate attacks to capture the remaining planets and close off the game.

That's kind of it.

I'm planning to iterate on this notebook.
A few ideas for improvement:
- Send ships from planets in the backline to planets on the frontline. Backline planets usually end up hoarding ships, might be better idea to send backline ships to populate frontline planets so we have better defense + faster captures.
- Planets cooperating together to capture planets. (eg. 2 owned planets each sending 50 ships to capture a target planet with 90 ships)
